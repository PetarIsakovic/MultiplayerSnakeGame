# Multiplayer Snake Game
Snake Fight is an online multiplayer game I developed in pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript along with Firebase for the backend. In this game, there are snakes controlled by opposing players with apples spawning every time one is consumed. The game will end once a snake hits itself or hits the opposing snake (the last snake standing wins).
